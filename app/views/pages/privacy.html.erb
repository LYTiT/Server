  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on and through LYTiT.</p>
  <p><b>The Information We Collect</b></p>
  <p>What we collect is dependent on the source of the information we collect from you. There is information that you voluntarily provide, such as when you sign up for or use LYTiT (i.e., e-mail address). The other information is data collected from your usage of LYTiT on your various devices (e.g., collecting geolocational data using the LYTiT app on mobile devices). This data is usually less specific to your identity and more related to statistics for our services. Some of the types of data we collect include log data (e.g., date and time) and device-related data (e.g., what the actual device being used is, the OS running on the device, certain device settings).</p>
  <p><b>The Way We Use Information</b></p>
  <p>We use the information you provide about yourself to provide our products and services to you and improve on them, customize your experience with LYTiT, and develop new products. This can range from logging usage data to determine what features are utilized most to using your ratings history, group affiliations, posted content (e.g., comments, photos, videos), visited venue pages, and geolocational data from the LYTiT mobile application to determine your tastes and suggest goods and services or tailor advertisements accordingly. Your account settings will also determine how we use information to interact with you, such as sending updates (e.g., notifications), or simply interacting with you directly (e.g., responding to questions or customer service reports).</p>
  <p>Information can be personally identifiable (i.e., information specific to you, like your e-mail address) or non-personally identifiable (i.e., information that can not be used to identify you in specific, like usage data for statistics). Both types and combinations thereof are used, and we may use or store information wherever LYTiT does business, including countries outside your own. We do not share information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to fulfill the above goals.</p>
  <p><b>The Way We Share Information</b></p>
  <p>When you use LYTiT, you may be sharing what you do with other users, your followers and friends, and/or the public, depending on how you configure your privacy settings.</p>
  <p>Aside from these instances that involve your direct interaction, we might share your information when we request your consent (such as when you share your activity on LYTiT on Facebook or Twitter) or when we use third-party companies or individuals to process data per the terms of this Privacy Policy (such as working with security consultants to make our products safer or identify spammers). Conversely, some of the information we request may be collected by third party providers on our behalf. We may also be compelled to share information with law enforcement or by judicial request (e.g., subpoenas) or to protect the safety, rights, or property of the public, any person, or LYTiT or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues. If LYTiT engages in a merger or acquisition or determines that it must dissolve, reorganize, or declare bankruptcy, such transactions and proceedings may involve the transfer of this information.</p>
  <p>As previously described, some data is non-personally identifiable or is aggregated for statistical analysis (which may be part of the service LYTiT provides by virtue of what the LYTiT mobile application is designed to do). This information may be shared with our partners or others, such as telling a merchant how many times one of their venues was viewed or visited or click-through rates.</p>
  <p><b>Our Commitment To Security</b></p>
  <p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect.</p>
  <p><b>Our Commitment To Children's Privacy</b></p>
  <p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never attempt to collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 16, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.</p>
