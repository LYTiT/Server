      <h1>THE LYTiT LUMEN GAME OFFICIAL RULES</h1>
      <p>THIS IS A PROMOTIONAL CONTEST. NO PURCHASE IS NECESSARY TO ENTER OR WIN. A PURCHASE WILL NOT INCREASE ENTRANT'S CHANCE OF WINNING. The in-app LYTiT Lumen Game is open to all legal US residents ages 18 and over who have a LYTiT Account registered using a valid .edu e-mail address("LYTiT Account"). The Promotion is void where prohibited or restricted by applicable law, and all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations apply. Winners are responsible for any taxes, customs, and duties and like amounts connected with the prizes.</p>
      <br /><br />
      <p><a style="font-family: Roboto-Light;font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;text-transform: uppercase;">1. Preliminary Information.</a> By entering in the LYTiT Lumen Game you accept and agree to be bound by these official rules (“Official Rules”). The LYTiT Lumen Game (“Promotion”) is sponsored by LYTiT Inc. located at 344 Third Avenue 17G, New York, NY 10010. The Promotion is subject to all applicable federal, state, municipal, and local laws and regulations. Void where prohibited by law.</p>
      <br />
      <p><a style="font-family: Roboto-Light;font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;text-transform: uppercase;">2. How to Enter.</a> To enter the Promotion, eligible Entrants must sign up by:
         <ol style="font-family: Roboto-Light;font-size: 18px;" type="i"> 
         <li>Downloading the LYTiT mobile application (“LYTiT APP”) either by visiting <a style="color: #00ccff;" href="http://www.lytit.com">www.lytit.com</a> or the iOS App Store</li>
         <li>Completing and submitting the account registration inside the LYTiT APP using a valid .edu e-mail address (“Registration”) (collectively, an “Entry”)</li>
         </ol></p>
      <p>Eligible Entrants may enter the Promotion beginning on May 15, 2015 once LYTiT has made the iOS LYTiT APP available for download.  Entrants who sign-up before the Entry Period (as defined below) begins will not earn Lumens for any activity completed before the Entry Period begins; however, if you download the LYTiT APP and fail to register an entrant’s account using a valid .edu e-mail address, you may still register an entrant’s account using a valid .edu e-mail address prior to the end of the Entry Period and receive credits for any Lumens earned during the Entry Period both prior to and after registering an entrant’s account using a valid .edu e-mail address.</p>
      <br />
      <p><a style="font-family: Roboto-Light;font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;text-transform: uppercase;">3. Eligibility. </a> “Entrant” means each individual that enters the Promotion and is eligible to do so according to the following requirements.  Eligibility to participate in the Promotion and to win prizes is limited to individual persons: 
      <ol style="font-family: Roboto-Light;font-size: 18px;" type="i">
         <li>At least 18 years of age as of the date they enter the Promotion</li>
         <li>Who are legal residents of the United States or its territories and possessions</li>
         <li>That are current LYTiT members</li>
         <li>Have a registered LYTiT Account using a valid .edu email address</li>
      </ol></p>
      <p><a style="font-family: Roboto-Light;font-size: 18px;"> Limit one (1) Registration and one (1) Entry per individual. Entrants who during the Entry Period (as defined below) that have violated the LYTiT <a style="color: #00ccff;" href="http://www.lytit.com/tnc">Terms and Conditions</a> or are otherwise not permitted to use LYTiT for any other reason will not be eligible to enter or win. Any effort by an Entrant to misrepresent himself or herself through the use of aliases or multiple e-mail addresses will result in disqualification. Registrations, Entries, or Lumens earned or generated by a script, macro, non-approved other automated means, unintended usage of the system, or in violation of the LYTiT Terms and Conditions (“LYTiT Terms”) are void. Entrants who disregard these Official Rules are not eligible to participate or win.  Directors, officers, employees, contractors and agents (and their immediate families and household members) of LYTiT, its parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, advertising and promotion agencies, including the Administrator, or any other company involved with the design, production, execution or distribution of the Promotion, and persons who were awarded a prize or received other promotional consideration from LYTiT within six (6) months prior to the beginning of the Entry Period are also not eligible. LYTiT's determination of eligibility, in its sole discretion, shall be final.</a></p>   
      <p><a style="font-family: Roboto-Light;font-size: 18px;text-decoration: underline">Entrants must have a registered LYTiT account, accessible only through the LYTiT mobile App (“LYTiT Account”), using a valid .edu e-mail address in order to enter and participate in the Promotion.</a> The LYTiT mobile app is available only for the iOS operating system.  Entrants are responsible for their own Internet and cellular access. Data rates may apply.  Entrants must also have a valid .edu e-mail address on file with LYTiT. Should multiple users be associated with the same LYTiT Account and a dispute thereafter arises regarding the identity of the Entrant, the primary account holder of record with LYTiT will be considered the Entrant.</p>
      <br />
      <p><a style="font-family: Roboto-Light;font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;text-transform: uppercase;">4. Entry Period.</a> The Lumen Game begins May 15, 2015 at 12:00:01 AM and ends July 31, 2015 at 11:59:59 PM (the “Entry Period”).</p>
      <p>The time for the beginning and the ending of the Entry Period is based on Eastern Time.</p>
      <br />
      <p><a style="font-family: Roboto-Light;font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;text-transform: uppercase;">5. How to Play.</a> Entrants will compete against other Entrants through their normal usage of the LYTiT APP to earn Lumens by posting interesting Content (as defined below) during the Entry Period.  Lumens are points assigned within LYTiT for engaging with the application. Lumens are awarded when you Map Moments (post texts, images, and videos) and respond to Moment Requests. Image and video posts further accumulate Lumens when others engage with Content. Posting Content that is interesting is a skill!  As further described below in Section 6, the winners will be selected based on how quickly an Entrant can earn 100 Lumens during the Entry Period. The ways to earn Lumens and the rules and limitations placed upon earning Lumens (such as the frequency in which Lumen earning activities can be completed), are set forth below and apply without exception to all actions taken via the LYTiT APP. The LYTiT Lumen value assessment (the “Lumen Calculation”) is a systematic assignment of Lumens based on posting frequency, type and reach.</p>
      <p><a style="font-family: Roboto-Light;font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;">Lumen Calculation:</a> Any image, video, or text submission (“Content”) you post via the LYTiT APP to earn Lumens has a lifespan of only 24 hours from the time it is posted, after which point it disappears.  For example, if an Entrant posts a photo or video at 8:01 pm on May 7th, 2015 it will disappear at 8:00:59 pm on May 8th, 2015.  Lumens may not be earned by Entrants on any Content once such Content’s 24 hour lifespan expires. The Lumen Calculation evaluates when another LYTiT user interacts (a “LYTiT Acknowledgment”) with an Entrant’s Content by either: 
      <ol style="font-family: Roboto-Light;font-size: 18px;" type="i">
         <li>Tapping the Entrant’s content in the Entrant’s “Happening" feed</li>
         <li>Tapping Content that appears on a venue page</li>
         <li>Hovering over entrant’s content in a venue page listing for 0.5 seconds (this is applicable in the "Happening" feed as well)</li>
      </ol></p>
       <p><a style="font-family: Roboto-Light;font-size: 18px;">The principle underlying LYTiT’s Lumen Calculation is that fresh, real-time, relevant, geo-location centric, and interesting Content is difficult to source and thus is “more valuable” to other LYTiT members. All final determinations regarding Lumen’s are at the sole discretion of LYTiT.  You may not challenge the Lumen Calculation.

       <p><a style="font-family: Roboto-Light;font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;">Limitations on earning Lumens:</a> There are limits as to how often and the method in which an entrant may earn lumens (some of which are set forth above) as follows: <ul style="font-family: Roboto-Light;font-size: 18px;">
         <li>Entrants can earn Lumen’s for the first Content posted at a location, but Entrants must wait five (5) minutes from the time of posting such Content before Entrants can earn Lumens on any subsequent Content submission at that same location.  This limitation is location specific, so you can go to a new location, post, and earn Lumens! Entrants may keep posting but will not earn Lumen’s until the allotted time has passed.  </li>
         <li>You will not be rewarded if it is determined by LYTiT in its sole discretion that entrants have or have attempted to manipulate the system with another user!</li>
       </ul> 
       <p><a style="font-family: Roboto-Light;font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;">Excessive or abusive use of the system will result in either no Lumens being awarded or disqualification.</a> Lumens will not be awarded for any Content that LYTiT, in its sole discretion, deems to be inappropriate, including because the Content is, or depicts conduct that is, violent sexually explicit, illegal, racially or morally offensive, infringes on  third party’s intellectual property or privacy rights, or contains Content of children under the age of thirteen (13) years old. LYTiT reserves the right to remove any inappropriate Content and disqualify Entrant or any such inappropriate Content and any Lumens resulting therefrom.</p>
       <p>When participating in the Promotion, all Entrants must continue to comply with LYTiT's <a style="color: #00ccff;" href="http://www.lytit.com/tnc">Terms and Conditions</a>. LYTiT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO, IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION, DISQUALIFY ANY ENTRANT LYTiT FINDS TO BE TAMPERING WITH THE ENTRY OR LUMEN PROCESS OR THE OPERATIONS OF THE LYTiT WEBSITE OR MOBILE APP; TO BE ACTING IN VIOLATION OF THE LYTIT TERMS, OR TO BE ACTING IN AN UNSPORTSMANLIKE OR DISRUPTIVE MANNER, OR WITH INTENT TO ANNOY, ABUSE, THREATEN OR HARASS ANY OTHER LYTiT MEMBER OR EMPLOYEE. ANY ENTRANTS THAT DO NOT COMPLY WITH THESE OFFICIAL RULES WILL BE VOID AND DISQUALIFIED.</p>
      <br />
      <p><a style="font-family: Roboto-Light;font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;text-transform: uppercase;">6. Winners.</a> The first 45 Entrants who validly earned a gross amount of 100 Lumens during the Entry Period shall be selected as the winners (each a “Winner”, and collectively, “Winners”). [Remember, Lumen Game winners are selected on a gross Lumen basis - you need to EARN at least 100 Lumens over the course of the Entry Period and not necessarily ever have a balance of 100 Lumens (i.e. Lumens spent on requests are not subtracted from your earnings in the Lumen Game).] The time at which an Entrant earns his or her Lumens is determined by LYTiT’s system, in its sole discretion.  Determination of the winners will occur/about three (3) business days after the close of the Entry Period, but may be expedited or delayed in LYTiT’s sole discretion.</p>
      <p>The LYTiT Lumen Calculation of the Lumens awarded shall be final and shall not be subject to dispute or recount. For the avoidance of doubt, the LYTiT APP tracks an Entrant’s gross Lumens and if Entrants have any questions or concerns regarding the accuracy of Entrant’s Lumen status please contact <a style="color: #00ccff;" href="mailto:support@lytit.com">support@lytit.com</a>.</p>
      <br />
      <p><a style="font-family: Roboto-Light;font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;text-transform: uppercase;">7. Winner Notification.</a> LYTiT will contact potential winners with an in-app notification that will alert them to verify their .edu e-mail addresses (as determined by the valid .edu e-mail address then on-file with LYTiT) on/about three (3) business days after the end of a monthly Lumen Game, but notifications may be expedited or delayed in LYTiT’s sole discretion.

All such documents must be completed and returned within five (5) days (including Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays) of attempted delivery of the same to the potential winner. If the documents are not returned within such time period, or if any sending of documentation is returned as undeliverable, LYTiT will have the right in its sole discretion to disqualify the potential winner without further notice and forfeit such potential winner’s prize. All results are unofficial until LYTiT’s acceptance of all potential winner's claim of the prize and completion of related documentation. Entrants that do not win will not be notified.</p>
